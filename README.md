<h1>MiniShell</h1>
Welcome to MiniShell, our lightweight version of a Unix shell. This project is a collaboration between <a href="https://github.com/vaismand/">vaismand</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Poddani">Poddani</a>, designed to emulate basic functionalities of traditional shells like Bash.

<h2>Overview</h2>
MiniShell aims to provide a simplified environment for executing commands, managing environment variables, and handling input/output redirections. It's built to offer insight into how shells operate behind the scenes, with a focus on process management and user interaction.

<h2>Features</h2>
- Execution of basic system commands.
- Support for builtin commands: cd, echo, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit.
- Environment variable management.
- Basic signal handling (e.g., SIGINT, SIGQUIT).
- Simple pipelines and redirections.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To use MiniShell, you'll need a Unix-like system with GCC and Make installed.

Installation:
```make```
```./minishell```
